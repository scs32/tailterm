# Native objective verification

Feature `wi_f23f767415ef9b30`, owner order #11571, assignment #11766,
prospective Start #11775. Owner decisions #11753–11755 approve the full local
matrix, a separate fifth verifier and native evidence with AIV unsubmitted.
Documentation supplement #11790 and fixture supplement #11806 retain scope.
Round-one correction #11865, exact Start #11877/release #11881 and owner decision
#11866 add the immutable post-rollout enrollment boundary. Corrected ownership
#11887 is the 47-path manifest; initial 13385477 is diagnostic only.

The builder freezes a commit. The handler independently freezes a version 1
plan before the verifier runs it. Plan selection uses the union of the saved
concrete ownership manifest and every base-to-candidate changed path, including
both rename sides and deletions. `verification/matrix.json` inventories every
standalone local browser entrypoint; imported helpers are covered by those parents.
Only the two explicit deployed-site entrypoints are excluded. Unknown paths,
changed inventory, omitted commands and missing prerequisites refuse execution.
Six formerly Chromium-only entrypoints accept `TEST_BROWSER=chromium|webkit`.
The WebKit microphone fixtures return a real oscillator-backed MediaStream;
application recording and AudioWorklet processing remain real. Their prototype
override survives WebKit media-device wrapper collection, and track stop is
idempotent. Static WebKit keeps real native keyboard paste, while fixture API
clipboard reads grant the permission normally presented by Safari's native
popover. This does not test that native permission UI. Its imported pane-group
helper and all assertions remain unchanged; only that invocation translates
Tab to Safari's native Option+Tab through the test page keyboard, restored in
`finally`. [Apple documents this traversal](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/cpsh003/mac).
Static voice cancellation leaves fixture fullscreen before sending real Escape;
the unchanged helper still checks microphone tracks end. Fullscreen coverage
remains in its separate stages. The fixture API clipboard permission is installed
per document so continuity reloads retain the same permission assumptions.
No host accessibility preferences or product keyboard code change.
Existing dual-engine entrypoints run both engines in one check. Narrow-layout
assertions remain in the full parent suites. Selected browser checks build and verify the local static package first.
Hub paths require vet, the full Go
suite and race checks on touched Go packages (all packages for directory ownership).
Every `hub/internal/store/` path selects migration rehearsal, covering schema SQL
outside migrate.go. Every Go check receives `VERIFICATION_BASE_COMMIT` from the
plan. Rehearsal creates the fixture database with that exact base implementation,
opens it with the candidate, reopens the base, reopens the candidate and checks
retained evidence plus integrity/foreign keys. The required check never uses an
item-specific hard-coded base. A direct unit invocation defaults to its checkout
HEAD; matrix execution always supplies the governing base. WASM changes build the test asset.

The normalized ownership manifest is handler-approved scope evidence, linked to
the raw assignment and its canonical ownership digest. The runner never parses
assignment prose. The handler must independently reproduce matrix selection from
that manifest and the full diff before saving a plan. The hub stores the approved
checks/digest independently of the producer receipt; it cannot inspect a remote
repository or attest command execution.

## Freeze, run and import

Create a plan input containing `itemTaskId`, `itemId`, `version`, `operationKey`, canonical `repository`,
exact `baseCommit` and `commit`, `itemRevision`, `scopeRevision`, `orderMessageSeq`,
`assignmentSeq`, `assignmentOwnershipDigest`, exact builder and verifier agent/run
IDs and `owned` (concrete paths), `approvedMatrixDigest` and
`matrixApprovalMessageSeq`. Approval must be a separate owner-authored Board
message whose entire trimmed text is `verification-matrix-approval:SHA256`.
The runner refuses candidate matrix bytes differing from that approved digest;
the native plan save verifies the owner source and token. A worker-authored token
or a candidate's replacement digest cannot authorize a weaker matrix. A new
matrix requires a new explicit owner approval. This is declared shared-workspace
provenance, under the same trust boundary as other owner messages. Canonical digests use recursively sorted JSON
keys, UTF-8 bytes and SHA-256; matrixDigest hashes the exact matrix file bytes.

```sh
node scripts/verify-matrix.mjs plan context.json plan.json
# Database handler only, on the candidate CLI:
tt verification plan --item ITEM --file plan.json --request-id KEY --generation 0
# A distinct verifier, in a fresh detached checkout of the exact commit:
node scripts/verify-matrix.mjs run plan.json /absolute/external/log-directory
# Database handler only, after checking every log's exact digest:
tt verification receipt --item ITEM --file /absolute/external/log-directory/receipt.json --request-id KEY --generation 1
tt verification history --item ITEM
```

Plans and receipts are append-only. Every mutation has a stable request ID and
expected generation. Identical retries return the saved record after later
lifecycle changes; altered payloads or competing generations conflict without
partial writes. A new plan invalidates the prior receipt without deleting it.
Scope/assignment changes and any different accepted SHA fail eligibility.
Administrative priority/status revisions retain the original evidence provenance.
The handler must freeze a new plan whenever the candidate matrix changes.
Unannounced filesystem changes cannot be observed by the hub; the runner checks
exact detached HEAD and clean tracked/untracked status before and after execution.

The runner strips inherited environment, hub/task credentials, runtime settings,
vaults and tmux identity, and assigns a disposable HOME/TMPDIR. Commands run with
argv arrays and repository-relative cwd. The receipt retains the absolute worktree,
allowlisted environment, prerequisite digests, command start/end/duration, exit,
external log path and exact SHA-256. It runs every selected check and retains
failures. The approved matrix records a default ten-minute per-check timeout,
with explicit overrides (race: fifteen minutes; unit/build/release: two minutes).
Each planned check carries `VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_MS` in its recorded environment.
A timeout sends SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 250 ms, only to that check's newly
spawned POSIX process group; its receipt records exit 124 and
`failureReason: timeout`, and preserves the failed log and digest. A timeout or
known-baseline failure is never a passing waiver. Browser checks requiring a fixed
port carry `VERIFICATION_REQUIRED_PORTS`; the runner refuses an occupied port
before spawning, recording the port and listener PID. It never terminates an
existing listener. Port inspection failure also refuses the check. These checks
are guardrails against pre-existing occupancy, not a reservation against a race
with another launcher. Required assets
include dependencies, installed Chromium/WebKit engines, test WASM, speech-fixture
WAV, Go module-license inventory and production WASM; copy the asset
from the root checkout only under the order's provenance allowance, and rebuild
when WASM source changes. Tests use disposable hubs, fake spawns and private tmux.

One transaction-level gate guards typed lead acceptance, PATCH done, keyed done
and queue acceptance. Bugs and features with a post-rollout team admission require a current passing
receipt. Enrollment is recorded atomically with the exact agent/run admission;
there is no request flag to opt out. Immutable SQL triggers refuse marker updates
or deletion. Rollout preserves pre-existing binding markers as
`legacy-pre-rollout`; unadmitted legacy work reports `legacy-no-team-admission`.
A new team on an existing item adds mandatory enrollment and cannot inherit a
legacy exemption. `tt verification enrollment --item ITEM` exposes that provenance
through the handler-only native endpoint. Legacy completion retains the previous
review/narrative requirements;
features also retain the existing complete narrative-report gate. Queue acceptance
also checks receipt repository/base against its accepted integration context.
Enrolled unknown review history cannot bypass the receipt requirement. Existing
saved historical completion remains readable. This changes completion after new admission;
it does not certify historical records or deploy a hub/CLI.

## AIV mapping boundary

`verification/receipt.schema.json` documents native v1. `operationKey` survives
native retries; `repository/baseCommit/commit`, matrix/check digests, environment,
check argv/cwd, times/exits and log URI/digest map to snapshot/run audit evidence.
Optional `aiv.service/repository/snapshot/extractor/run/audit` bindings are retained
verbatim with mandatory `state: unsubmitted`. Native fixtures exercise those
fields; no external wire compatibility, `record_run` submission, `audit_verify`
checkpoint, receipt or external idempotency is claimed. The existing spec lacks
that exact contract; external submission is the separately approved phase two.

The shared-workspace credential makes handler and verifier identity declared
native provenance, not cryptographic attestation. The handler checks roster/run,
item admission, saved order/assignment/scope, independence from builder/reviewer,
and approved check coverage. It cannot prove a producer actually executed a
command merely from submitted JSON. The owner-run bootstrap exception #11796
applies to this item's acceptance evidence only; future teams use the fifth member.

Race selection inspects Go package directories in the exact candidate Git tree.
Deleted and renamed-away paths remain in coverage selection, but are excluded
from command targets; existing moved destinations are selected. If no touched
package survives, the race check falls back to `./...`. Tests execute the real Go
race command after a complete package move and deletion.
